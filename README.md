Mechanisms that control internet access handle the problem of screening a particular network or an organization from unwanted communication. Such mechanisms can help prevent outsiders from obtaining private information, changing information or disrupting communication on organizationsâ€™ internal internet. Unlike authentication and privacy mechanisms, which can be added to application programs, internet access control usually requires to basic components of internet infrastructure. In particular, successful access control requires a careful combination of restrictions on network topology, immediate information staging, and packet filters. A single technique has emerged as the basis for internet access control. The technique places a block known as an internet firewall at the entrance to the part of the internet to be protected.
